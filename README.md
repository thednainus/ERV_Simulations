# ERV_Simulations
version 1.0 to simulate the evolution of ERVs

I have upload 4 main Python codes named them as "Master_Mortal.py", "Master_Imortal.py", "Transposon_Mortal.py", and "Transposon_Immortal.py".
I have also uploaded three Python classes (Random_functions.py, Tree_utilities.py, and writeFiles.py) with functions necessary for the main codes.

The main codes simulates phylogenetic trees following variations of the Master and Transposon models of ERV/Transposable element evolution in host genomes.
A paper has been recently submitted for publication, explaining in details these simulations.
